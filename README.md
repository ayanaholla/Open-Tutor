# Open-Tutor:GUI based study portal for sorting algorithms
## OpenTutor was developed using the concepts of Java Swings (Graphical User Interface widget toolkit for java) and Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and aims to aid all users interested in learning about the important sorting algorithms for educational purposes to have an interactive learning experience with the visualizations. These sorts are usually described in order to demonstrate how run time of algorithms are estimated.
